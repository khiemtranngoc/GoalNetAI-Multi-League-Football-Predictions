I have shared 2 folders from my drive
train: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q1jLLHKKbk4vYU6OB0uqF0CBzfsvAGPM?usp=sharing
test: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aLESEge85oc1P7LvziWUnkwUfloWvBHY?usp=sharing

All you have to do is download these 2 folders and upload them into your drive (train, test)

The train folder contains the data from all countries from the season 2000-2022. Each country would have a different number division
for example, England 0 would be the Premier League, England 1 would be the EFL Championship.

The test folder contains unseen data from the 2023 season
